break the ice, hit the nail on the head, let the cat out of the bag, piece of cake, cost an arm and a leg, once in a blue moon, spill the beans, under the weather, beat around the bush, miss the boat, get cold feet, break a leg, sit on the fence, kill two birds with one stone, let someone off the hook, burn the midnight oil, get something off your chest, make a long story short, on the ball, pull someone's leg, run out of steam, take it with a grain of salt, throw in the towel, through thick and thin, turn a blind eye, up in the air, wear your heart on your sleeve, when pigs fly, a blessing in disguise, a dime a dozen, add fuel to the fire, back to square one, bite the bullet, break the bank, by the skin of your teeth, cry over spilled milk, cut corners, down to earth, face the music, get a kick out of, get the ball rolling, give someone the benefit of the doubt, go the extra mile, hang in there, have a change of heart, keep your fingers crossed, let sleeping dogs lie, lose your touch, make ends meet, miss the mark, play it by ear, read between the lines, see eye to eye, speak of the devil, step up to the plate, take a rain check, that's the way the cookie crumbles, time flies
