a blessing in disguise, a dime a dozen, a drop in the ocean, a fool and his money are soon parted, a picture is worth a thousand words, a stitch in time saves nine, actions speak louder than words, add insult to injury, all that glitters is not gold, an arm and a leg, back to the drawing board, bite the bullet, break the ice, burn bridges, by the skin of your teeth, call it a day, cut corners, devil's advocate, don't count your chickens before they hatch, every cloud has a silver lining, get cold feet, get the ball rolling, go down in flames, go the extra mile, hit the nail on the head, in hot water, jump ship, keep your chin up, kill two birds with one stone, let the cat out of the bag, miss the boat, off the top of your head, once in a blue moon, out of the frying pan and into the fire, pull someone's leg, rain on someone's parade, read between the lines, see eye to eye, sit on the fence, spill the beans, strike while the iron is hot, take a rain check, throw caution to the wind, through thick and thin, tie the knot, turn a blind eye, under the weather, when pigs fly, you can't have your cake and eat it too
