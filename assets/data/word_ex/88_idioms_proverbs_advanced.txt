a blessing in disguise, a dime a dozen, a drop in the ocean, a fool and his money are soon parted, a penny for your thoughts, a picture is worth a thousand words, a stitch in time saves nine, actions speak louder than words, add insult to injury, all that glitters is not gold, an arm and a leg, back to the drawing board, bite the bullet, break the ice, burn bridges, by the skin of your teeth, call it a day, caught between a rock and a hard place, chew the fat, cut corners, don’t count your chickens before they hatch, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, every cloud has a silver lining, feather in your cap, get cold feet, get your act together, give someone the benefit of the doubt, go the extra mile, hit the nail on the head, in hot water, keep your chin up, kill two birds with one stone, let the cat out of the bag, make a mountain out of a molehill, miss the boat, once in a blue moon, out of the frying pan and into the fire, pull someone’s leg, rain on someone’s parade, read between the lines, saved by the bell, spill the beans, strike while the iron is hot, take it with a grain of salt, the ball is in your court, the best of both worlds, the elephant in the room, the last straw, throw caution to the wind, under the weather, when pigs fly, you can’t have your cake and eat it too
