if it rains, take an umbrella, will get wet, unless you hurry, will be late, if you study hard, will pass the exam, if she calls, let me know, if I have time, will help you, if he doesn't leave now, will miss the bus, if we don't act now, will face problems, if you heat ice, it melts, if you don't water plants, they die, if I were you, would accept the offer, if I had more money, would travel the world, if she studied harder, would get better grades, if they invited me, would attend the party, if it weren't so expensive, would buy it, if I lived closer, would visit more often, if he spoke louder, people would understand him, if we left earlier, wouldn't be stuck in traffic, even if it's difficult, will try my best, as long as you promise, will believe you, provided that you follow the rules, will allow you to join, suppose you won the lottery, what would you do, imagine you were famous, how would you feel, if I didn't have to work, would stay home, if there were no traffic, would arrive on time, if I knew the answer, would tell you, if she weren't afraid of flying, would go by plane
